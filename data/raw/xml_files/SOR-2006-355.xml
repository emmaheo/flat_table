Act</XRefExternal>, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (the “Commission”) shall implement the Canadian telecommunications policy objectives set out in section 7 of that Act, in accordance with the following:</Text><Paragraph><Label>(a)</Label><Text>the Commission should</Text><Subparagraph><Label>(i)</Label><Text>rely on market forces to the maximum extent feasible as the means of achieving the telecommunications policy objectives, and</Text></Subparagraph><Subparagraph><Label>(ii)</Label><Text>when relying on regulation, use measures that are efficient and proportionate to their purpose and that interfere with the operation of competitive market forces to the minimum extent necessary to meet the policy objectives;</Text></Subparagraph></Paragraph><Paragraph><Label>(b)</Label><Text>the Commission, when relying on regulation, should use measures that satisfy the following criteria, namely, those that</Text><Subparagraph><Label>(i)</Label><Text>specify the telecommunications policy objective that is advanced by those measures and demonstrate their compliance with this Order,</Text></Subparagraph><Subparagraph><Label>(ii)</Label><Text>if they are of an economic nature, neither deter economically efficient competitive entry into the market nor promote economically inefficient entry,</Text></Subparagraph><Subparagraph><Label>(iii)</Label><Text>if they are not of an economic nature, to the greatest extent possible, are implemented in a symmetrical and competitively neutral manner, and</Text></Subparagraph><Subparagraph><Label>(iv)</Label><Text>if they relate to network interconnection arrangements or regimes for access to networks, buildings, in-building wiring or support structures, ensure the technological and competitive neutrality of those arrangements or regimes, to the greatest extent possible, to enable competition from new technologies and not to artificially favour either Canadian carriers or resellers; and</Text></Subparagraph></Paragraph><Paragraph><Label>(c)</Label><Text>the Commission, to enable it to act in a more efficient, informed and timely manner, should adopt the following practices, namely,</Text><Subparagraph><Label>(i)</Label><Text>to use only tariff approval mechanisms that are as minimally intrusive and as minimally onerous as possible,</Text></Subparagraph><Subparagraph><Label>(ii)</Label><Text>with a view to increasing incentives for innovation and investment in and construction of competing telecommunications network facilities, to complete a review of its regulatory framework regarding mandated access to wholesale services, to determine the extent to which mandated access to wholesale services that are not essential services should be phased out and to determine the appropriate pricing of mandated services, which review should take into account the principles of technological and competitive neutrality, the potential for incumbents to exercise market power in the wholesale and retail markets for the service in the absence of mandated access to wholesale services, and the impediments faced by new and existing carriers seeking to develop competing network facilities,</Text></Subparagraph><Subparagraph><Label>(iii)</Label><Text>to publish and maintain performance standards for its various processes, and</Text></Subparagraph><Subparagraph><Label>(iv)</Label><Text>to continue to explore and implement new approaches for streamlining its
